# Espresso
_DApp in Ethereum for a Coffee trade Supply Chain_

## Description

# Local Development
The project is divided into a backend that publishes _smart contracts_ to the _Ethereum network_, and a frontend that allows the interaction with them.

## Technology Stack
- [Solidity](#)
- [Truffle](#)
- [Web3.js](#)

- Solidity v0.5.16
- openzeppelin-solidity v2.4.0
- Truffle v5.1.60
- Node v15.3.0
- Web3.js v1.2.9

## Set Up
### Prerequisites
Please make sure you've already installed ganache-cli, Truffle and enabled MetaMask extension in your browser.

Truffle is a development environment tha manage the contract artifacts.
The right version is included in the `package.json` so you only need to download the dependencies

```shell
# install all dependencies
$ npm install
```

To sync a MetaMask wallet you should create a `.secret` file and add the mnemonic as plain text

```shell
# create the file that will contain the MetaMask mnemonic
touch .secret
```

## Build
### Backend
To generate the contracts artifacts and deploy them to a local blockchain network using truffle, run:
```shell
# start a local network and run the truffle console
$ truffle develop
# creates the bytecode and the ABI
> compile
# deploys the contracts to the local network
> migrate --reset
```

### Frontend
In a separate terminal window, launch the DApp:
```shell
# runs lite-server 
$ npm run dev
```

and visit http://localhost/index.html

## Run Tests
The test should be run after the contract is migrated
```shell
$ truffle test
```

---
# Deployment

## Publish
Publishing the _smart contract_ into a public network requires a wallet with Ether

```shell
# publish into rinkeby test network
truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby
```
