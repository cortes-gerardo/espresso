# Espresso
_DApp in Ethereum for a Coffee trade Supply Chain_

## Description
Espresso is a decentralized application _(DApp)_ for the supply chain of coffee backed by the _Ethereum platform_.

The product is tracked and verified by each member of the supply chain.
First by the Farmer, then the Distributor, the Retailer, and the Consumer, each actor with specific functions.

# Local Development
The project is divided into a backend that publishes _smart contracts_ to the _Ethereum network_, and a frontend that allows the interaction with them.

## Technology Stack
- Truffle v5.1.65: As a framework for developing and testing the _smart contracts_. 
- Web3.js v1.2.9: Is the library that connects to the blockchain network and allows the interaction with the contract.
- lite-server 2.4.0: As a node server to exposes the frontend section.
- Node v15.3.0: As a framework over all the libraries are running and the package management system.
- @truffle/hdwallet-provider v1.2.1: this provides the wallet to interact with the Rinkeby network.

## Set Up
### Prerequisites
Please make sure you've already installed ganache-cli, Truffle and enabled MetaMask extension in your browser.

Truffle is a development environment tha manage the contract artifacts.
The right version is included in the `package.json` so you only need to download the dependencies

```shell
# install all dependencies
$ npm install
```

To sync a MetaMask wallet you should create a `.secret` file and add the mnemonic as plain text

```shell
# create the file that will contain the MetaMask mnemonic
touch .secret
```

## Build
### Backend
To generate the contracts artifacts and deploy them to a local blockchain network using truffle, run:
```shell
# start a local network and run the truffle console
$ truffle console
# or if you don't have ganache running
$ truffle develop
# creates the bytecode and the ABI
> compile
# deploys the contracts to the local network
> migrate --reset
```

### Frontend
In a separate terminal window, launch the DApp:
```shell
# runs lite-server 
$ npm run dev
```

and visit http://localhost/3000

## Run Tests
The test should be run after the contract is migrated
```shell
$ truffle test
```

---
# Deployment

## Publish
Publishing the _smart contract_ into a public network requires a wallet with Ether, and an Infura account.
Store the mnemonic of the wallet with founds in the `.secret` file

```shell
# publish into rinkeby test network
truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby
```
